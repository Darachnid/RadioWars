Jail, Incapacitation, and Execution Mechanics

1. Engagement and Capture Mechanics

	•	Capture: Incapacitated or surrendered players can be taken to a jail within the captor’s territory.
	•	Jail: Jails are holding areas for captured players. Captured players are freed if their team takes over the jail.
2. Surrender

	•	A player who chooses to surrender cannot carry the flag, and must drop it immediately if holding it at the time of surrender.
	•	All weapons held by the player are deactivated during the surrender.

2. Incapacitation Mechanics

	•	Incapacitation: Captured players hit with additional IR shots become “incapacitated.” A player must drop the flag when incapacitated.
	•	Restriction: Incapacitated players cannot move or engage in gameplay actions.
	•	Vulnerability: Incapacitated players are vulnerable to capture and execution and must wait for a Medic for revival.

3. Medic Role in Reactivation

	•	Revival Process: Medics revive incapacitated players through a revival procedure.
	•	Strategic Value: Reviving players is crucial for maintaining team strength and requires careful planning and protection of the Medic.

4. Execution Mechanics

	•	Executing Prisoners: Teams have the option to execute captured or incapacitated players.
	•	Execution Rules: Execution is done by additional IR shots and results in the player being permanently removed from the current game round.
	•	Strategic Considerations: Executing a player can be a tactical decision to permanently reduce the opposing team’s manpower. However, it removes the possibility of using the player as a bargaining chip in negotiations.

5. Strategic Considerations for Capturing, Incapacitating, and Executing

	•	Teams must balance the advantages and risks of capturing, incapacitating, or executing opponents.
	•	Capturing provides negotiation leverage, incapacitating temporarily reduces threats, and executing permanently reduces enemy numbers.
	•	The decision should be based on the player’s role, location, and current game situation.

6. Jail and Prisoner Management

	•	Controlling jails and managing prisoners becomes a critical aspect of gameplay.
	•	Teams must decide whether to guard jails heavily or use resources elsewhere, and whether to negotiate for prisoners or execute them for a tactical advantage.
