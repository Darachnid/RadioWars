# Weapons, damage, and health mechanics

## Health Thresholds

Health thresholds are variables that depend on a player's roles.

- Incapacitation: A player is incapacitated when health is below this threshold

## Damage Thresholds

Damage thresholds are variables that depend on a player's roles and the amount of time it took to incur damage. A damage threshold must be met in a period of time that depends on the target's role.

- Drop flag: A player holding the flag must drop it if the player takes x damage in y seconds.
