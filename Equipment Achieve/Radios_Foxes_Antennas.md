# Radios, Foxes, and Directional Antennas

*Disclaimer:* To use any of the fox transmitters mentioned here, a ham radio license is required. Information on obtaining this license can be found at [HamStudy.org](https://hamstudy.org). Although the suggested radio can be used to transmit, a license is not needed merely to receive signals, which is sufficient for participation in the game as long as someone licensed is responsible for the foxes.

## Radios

- **[Baofeng UV-5R](https://www.baofengradio.com/products/uv-5r)**: This is the most basic and straightforward option for those new to radio use. It is capable of both transmitting (which requires a license) and receiving. For participating in the game, manual usage of the VFO to enter the fox's frequency is all that's needed. While a programming cable is a useful tool for ham operators using repeaters, it's not necessary for fox hunting.

## Antennas

Directional antennas are pivotal in radio-based activities like fox hunting for their ability to pinpoint signal directions. They are popular for educational purposes, being easy to build and offering fast, rewarding results. While not strictly necessary for fox hunting, as some enthusiasts prefer techniques like body blocking, directional antennas greatly enhance the experience by providing a clear direction to the signal source.

## Attenuators

Attenuators are crucial in fox hunting for managing signal strength, especially when close to the transmitter. When too near, signals can become omnidirectional, making pinpointing challenging. An attenuator helps by reducing signal strength, allowing for more precise direction finding. A quick alternative method is to drift the VFO up and down to manage signal strength without an attenuator.

## Foxes
Fox transmitters, or 'foxes', are hidden transmitters used in radio fox hunting. They transmit signals for participants to locate using directional antennas and other radio direction-finding techniques.
