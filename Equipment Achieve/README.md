# Radio Wars Equipment Archive

The Radio Wars Equipment Archive is a curated collection of design blueprints and specifications for the equipment used in the Radio Wars game. 

## Purpose

1. **Learning and Innovation**: It provides an opportunity for players to delve into the technological aspects of the game, fostering learning and innovation. Players can explore different designs, understand how they work, and even contribute their own ideas.

2. **Cost Management**: By allowing teams to procure or build their own equipment, we aim to offset the costs for game organizers. This approach not only makes the game more accessible but also adds an element of customization and personal involvement.

3. **Standardization and Safety**: To ensure fairness and safety, only equipment designs included in this archive are permitted for use in the game. Each design is carefully reviewed to meet our standards of playability and safety.

4. **DIY Kits for Local Teams**: We are working on procuring parts in bulk to create DIY kits for these designs, which we plan to sell locally to interested teams. This initiative is aimed at reducing the burden on teams in sourcing components and encourages local team participation.

5. **Commitment and Responsibility**: Owning and maintaining game equipment signifies a team's commitment to the game. The responsibility of gear maintenance and operation lies with each team, fostering a sense of ownership and team spirit.

6. **Open Design Submission**: We encourage players to bring new ideas to the table. If you have a design that you believe could enhance the game, we have a process for assessing and potentially including new designs in our archive. This process ensures that new equipment meets certain safety, fairness, and gameplay requirements.

This archive is not just a repository of information; it's a platform for continuous improvement, learning, and engagement with the Radio Wars community.
